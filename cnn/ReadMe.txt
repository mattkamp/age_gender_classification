This is a project for Social Network Analysis and Social Media Analytics 
course in Master in Business Analytics in AUEB 

The goal was gender recognition of facial images. MLP and CNN neural networks 
implementations were used with tensorflow library.

Preparation Utilities must run first in order for the routines to be loaded in memory and then 
the files run assuming that train_path variables point to a directory where the data exist 
in files one for each class. 

All experiment results are ImagesResultGender file. 

The secondary implementation can be opened and run on a jupyter notebook.
