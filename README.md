# Age and Gender Classification using Neural Networks

This is a course project for the MSc in Business Analytics of the Athens University of Economics and Business. It primarily focuses on gender and age classification based on images. 

Data accesss steps, in order to run scripts included:
1) Download "faces only" files (wiki images) from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki
2) Unzip and place inside a folder named "dataset"
3) Run included matlab scripts, to create csv files. These files are used for loading the final data, from every python script of the project.

Individuals involved in the project:
